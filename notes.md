## Current Situation and Constraints

- Property owned by father
- Initially given permission for personal use
- Concerns raised about liability and potential misuse
- No parties, gatherings, or public events allowed
- No electricity available
- Drinking is a liability concern
- Limited to personal use with a few friends
- Father is concerned about lawsuits and negligence due to professional background

## Actual Plans

- Small-scale hangout spot for a few friends
- Activities: grilling, relaxing, talking, chilling
- Minimal setup: grill, cooler for drinks, table, chairs, firepit
- Landscaping work: flattening out the top of the hill
- Comparable to real-life Minecraft for the group

## Website Purpose

- Personal project to showcase web development skills
- Not intended to attract public or sell tickets
- Primarily for communication between friends

## Potential Solutions

1. Add legal protection:
   - Implement NDA + liability waiver + arbitration clause
   - Require users to agree to terms before accessing the site or event information
   - Consider OAuth integration with social media for identity verification

2. Update site messaging:
   - Clearly state the private nature of the property
   - Emphasize that it's not open to the public
   - Remove any references to ticket sales or public events

3. Access control:
   - Implement a private access system for authorized users only
   - Use invite codes or personal logins to restrict site access

4. Communication with father:
   - Develop a clear, concise explanation of the project's scope
   - Address liability concerns directly in the site's terms
   - Provide regular updates on the project's development
